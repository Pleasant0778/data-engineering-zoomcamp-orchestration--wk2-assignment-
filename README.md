# NYC Taxi Data Pipeline with Kestra, Docker, and Google Cloud

This project implements a complete end-to-end ELT pipeline using Kestra as the orchestrator, Docker Compose for local infrastructure to spring up kestra , and Google Cloud Platform (bucket and BigQuery) as the storage and data lake. The pipeline ingests monthly NYC Yellow and Green Taxi trip data from 2019 - 2021, thhe csv dataset are stored in Google Cloud Storage, and loaded to the big query sing merge to avoid duplicates.

The design follows production-grade data engineering practices including idempotent loads, conditional branching, external tables, merge-based deduplication, centralized configuration, and workflow-driven infrastructure setup.

## Architecture Overview

NYC TLC CSV.gz files (GitHub Releases)  
→ Kestra Scheduled Workflow  
→ Google Cloud Storage (raw CSV)  
→ BigQuery External Tables  
→ BigQuery Partitioned Tables  
→ MERGE for deduplication  

-------

## Technologies Used

- Kestra (workflow orchestration)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Google Cloud Storage
- BigQuery
- PostgreSQL (Kestra metadata & queue)
- Shell scripting
- SQL
- NYC TLC public dataset

---

## Google Cloud Configuration with Kestra KV

Kestra Open Source does not include a secrets manager. Instead, this project uses Kestra’s Key-Value (KV) store to manage Google Cloud configuration and authentication.

The full Google Cloud service account JSON key is stored as a STRING KV and injected into all GCP plugins automatically.

KV keys used:
- GCP_PROJECT_ID
- GCP_LOCATION
- GCP_BUCKET_NAME
- GCP_DATASET
- GCP_CRED (full service account JSON)

## Conlcusion

This project exposed me to many new concepts. Beyond orchestration, scheduling and backfill execution, I learned that Kestra can also be used to provision cloud services in a way that is similar to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), much like Terraform. However, unlike Terraform, Kestra does not maintain state in the same way, nor does it automatically handle resource destruction. These capabilities may exist in some form, but further research is required to fully understand them.

Overall, using YAML to define everything made the workflow straightforward and easy to follow. Thanks to our instructors, making the structure and approach simplified annd also provideing YAML template for learning and doing the assignment.
